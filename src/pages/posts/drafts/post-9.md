## Things I want to add 
 
## Introduction

In this post, I present my personal views on focus and thoughts I had on how to work with yourself. 


No matter what goals you've set for yourself, 
I often feel like after all the books you've read and all the advice you've gotten, what truly matters in the end is: When I'm doing activity "X", and I start to struggle or run into a problem, how efficient will I be at handling discomfort? How will I consistently apply an optimal strategy to solve a problem? What I really want to emphasize throughout this post is no matter how many good strategies you know, in the moment, when you struggle with something, how quick will you be at recentering your focus

&nbsp;


### Adapting strategies

When should you stop being tenacious? 


### Downtimes and Calibration

Planning your downtimes accordingly. Then again, sometimes you can plan them others times not.

### Overreactions to incompetence


Oftentimes, the biggest weight on my mind . If I expect to get something faster than a given time frame, then that imposes a break. The trick really is to forget who you are while you focus and adapt a outsider point of view that understands you fully.
Trust is the ability to be ok returning to something Being ok with disconnecting and going back.
What's more?
Discomfort disappears with experience and experience is gained thorugh concistensy.


### Asking for help 





### The Finish line and pacing yourself.

Let's say you've told yourselves to focus for one hour, you could get happy with solving a problem and wonder off.
Feeling like you can have to finish everything at once. 








### To add

Feeling like you have to figure everything out yourself , everyone great people hang out together and grow together
Rushing loses more time?
What will you do on your downtimes?
Being tenacious at the wrong state of mind.
There's no point in pedestalizing what you want 
It's about forgetting to apply the optimal strategy every time.
Let's say you've set a timer to focus on a task for an hour,
