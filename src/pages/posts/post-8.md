## Timeline



I'm into memories and nostalgia. I was never consistent with writing until about 4 years ago.  


## Why a blog?

Journaling is very different from blogging. When it comes to writing about happened in my day for example, I could write non-stop, but when it comes to expressing my thoughts for someone to understand, I feel like there's a few more hurdles I have to overcome. It never really crossed my mind to write for the sake of others until I started a blog. I wanted to get better at relaying what was in my brain to other brains.
