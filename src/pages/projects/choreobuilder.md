This post is being updated as I work on ChoreoBuilder.

## Why?

Part of my life  I have is learning a song on an instrument and perform to it. 




## Uploading a Routine

- Getting audio files from your Files to create separate parts with them
- Copying files to your sandbox.



## FileUploadView




## AudioPlayerModel

There are different functions to implement for a functional AudioPlayer. 

1. Looping

2. Custom Loop

3. Delay




## Controls to implement



## To Fix 

- Drag gesture on the mini-audio player


## Things I learned

1. DropViewDelegate inside a Scrollview





## Footnotes
