This post is being updated as I work on ChoreoBuilder.

## Why?

When I was living in Japan, I was given precious opportunities to perform in festivals and community events in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kihoku,_Mie" class="secondary-a"> town </a> I was living in.<sup class="secondary-a" href="#footnotes" >1.</sup>.  Whenever I create a choreography for a tune, I split the audio in parts and write notes on my iPad on what moves or transitions I can do. My motivation with ChoreoBuilder was to streamline this process.



## Uploading a Choreography

Initially, the main idea is to upload audio files

- Getting audio files from your Files to create separate parts with them
- Copying files to your sandbox.



## FileUploadView




## Playing with AVAudioPlayer

## What to build 
Much of the functionality I've implemented was based on the VLC iOS app.  


1. Custom Loop: Allowing the perfomer to practice a specific section inside the part
2. Delay: For a part, we want the performer to be able to have their own countdown







## To Fix 

- Drag gesture on the mini-audio player



## Things I learned

1. DropViewDelegate inside a Scrollview
2. Building a custom expandable AudioPlayer





## Footnotes

1. For reference, I juggle and dance to tunes I learn. For example, what I like to do is learn a song on piano  and then  build a dance/juggling choreography with it.
