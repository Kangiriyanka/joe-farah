## Why? 

 As we get older, life gets in the way, and we don't have much time to pick up a controller or even feel guilty about doing so. I wanted to create a place where we can at least reminisce and feel the magic about the good times of games we enjoyed.

&nbsp;

## Overview 

### What? 
Gameok (pronounced game-uhk) <sup> <a class="secondary-a" href="#footnotes">1.</a></sup> is a game library where users browse their game collection and write memories about the games they played. The main color scheme is based on the N64.

&nbsp;


The basic usage is as follows:

- Admin creates consoles and games to the database.
- Users add games by selecting consoles and the games they own/played on them.
- Users can see what games they have on each console once added.
- Users can add/edit/delete memories about their games.

&nbsp;


###  Home Page


The home component first displays the number of consoles and games the user has. Graph data is also available to see the user's game count across 3 different categories: 
-  game count per year bracket
-  game count  per series (Top 5)
-  game count of per console (Top 5)

&nbsp; 

The graphs have been created with <a class="secondary-a" href="https://recharts.org/en-US">Recharts</a>. It was a much simpler alternative to D3 which I initially considered. If you look at my personal data, you'll notice that I'm stuck in the past.

&nbsp;

### Consoles Page

The consoles page displays all the consoles the user has. When a user selects a console, they can see all the games on it. I've added an example of the N64 games I own. <sup> <a class="secondary-a" href="#footnotes">2.</a></sup>


![Consoles](../../assets/project_images/gameok/consoles.png)
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Once you select a game, you can see the notes/memories taken. The content is all formatted in Markdown, and the editor is <a href="https://mdxeditor.dev/" class="secondary-a"> MDXEditor</a>.

&nbsp;


### Games Page

Instead of consoles, you can view all your games in a data table created following this <a class="secondary-a" href="https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/data-table"> Shadcn's data table guide</a>. You can filter the rows, access the game's memories and delete games from it.

![Games Table Filter](../../assets/project_images/gameok/filter.png)

&nbsp;

### Add Games Page 

A user can add games to their collection by selecting a console and then a game. Let's add Pokémon Emerald on the Game Boy Advance!

&nbsp;



### Authentication Components

There are authentication components for logging in, registering and changing the user's password.

![Change Password](../../assets/project_images/gameok/Auth3.png)


&nbsp;

### Admin Components

The admin has reserved pages to add consoles and games.

## Navigation

### A change of routes

For Gameok, I used the Data mode of React Router. The Declarative mode wasn't enough for the complexity I was aiming for, and I thought it was a decent middle ground before jumping to Framework mode<sup> <a class="secondary-a" href="#footnotes">3.</a></sup>. Loaders, nesting (outlet), and error boundaries are all great features.

```tsx
// App.tsx
return (
  <>
  <RouterProvider router={router} />
  </>

)

// routes.ts
export const router  = createBrowserRouter([
  ...publicRoutes,
  ...protectedRoutes,
  ...adminRoutes
]);

// protected-routes.ts
export  const protectedRoutes = [

  { 
    path: "/dashboard",
    Component: ProtectedRoute,
    children: [
      {
        Component: RootLayout,
        // RootLayout holds a Sidebar component which has extra links for the admin.
        loader: adminLoader,
        ErrorBoundary: ErrorBoundary,
        children: [
          {
            path: "home",  
            Component: Home,
            loader: statsLoader,
            ErrorBoundary: ErrorBoundary,
          },
          {
            path: "consoles",
            Component: Consoles,
            loader: consolesLoader,
            ErrorBoundary : ErrorBoundary,
          },
        ]
        // ... Other components
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
&nbsp;


### React's Context

To see how authentication is implemented, we start with React's Context. A Context object can be seen as a container that holds a shared state and provides it when children are nested inside of it. When creating the context, we define the type of data it can hold and pass the actual values inside the provider's <b class="bold-rounded"> value </b> attribute. The tricky part is that you use the same Context object to create the provider.

 &nbsp; 

In action now, we define an AuthProvider function and wrap it around the RouterProvider. All the components defined in the router have access to the context provided by AuthProvider.


```tsx
// Provides access to the context to any component rendered by the router.
<AuthProvider>
    <RouterProvider router={router} />     
</AuthProvider>

```
&nbsp;

where AuthProvider is:

```tsx
import userInfo from '../assets/scripts/userInfo.ts';
// 1. This is the data we want our components to access when they use the context (consume its data).
type AuthTools = {
    storedUserInfo: string | null;
    setUserInfo: (username: string) => void;
}

type Props = { children: React.ReactNode }

// AuthContext defined to be later used as a provider *.
const AuthContext = createContext<AuthTools | undefined>(undefined);

export function AuthProvider({ children }: Props) {
    // setUserInfo 
    const { storedUserInfo, setUserInfo } = userInfo();

    return (
        // Pass the values to the AuthContext provider *.
        // In React 19, you don't need to add .provider (makes it even more confusing if you ask me)
        <AuthContext value={{ storedUserInfo, setUserInfo }}>
            {children}
        </AuthContext>
    );
}
// This is the function a component can call to access storedUserInfo or setUserInfo.
// If a component that isn't wrapped by the AuthProvider tries to access the context, it throws an error.
export function useAuthContext() {
    const authTools = useContext(AuthContext);
    if (authTools === undefined) {
        throw new Error("useAuthContext must be used within an AuthContext");
    }

    return authTools;
}
```
&nbsp;

- AuthTools is the data provided by the context: a username and a function that sets it.  

- The useAuthContext is a function that can be called inside any component living  inside the AuthProvider. Otherwise, it'll throw an error.

&nbsp;


An application of this would be allowing only authenticated users inside protected routes. When a user successfully logs in, the server sends back a response to the client with a username inside. Then, with the useAuthContext function, we destructure the 'setUserInfo' function from the AuthContext and call it with the received username. This changes the state of the app to match the logged in user's username. 

&nbsp; 

![Login](../../assets/project_images/gameok/login.png)
&nbsp; 


As a result, once there's stored information about the user, we can open the gates of nerdiness and permit access to the Protected Routes.

```tsx
// ProtectedRoute.tsx
// storedUserInfo is set if the user logs in succesfully.
 const {storedUserInfo} = useAuthContext();
   if (!storedUserInfo) return <Navigate to="/" replace />;
// A store of components ;)
    return <Outlet />;

```








&nbsp;

## Authentication


I extensively used Flask <a href="https://flask-jwt-extended.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basic_usage.html" class="secondary-a"> Flask-JWT-Extended </a> for authentication. 

&nbsp;

### Local Storage approach
Now, with contexts in mind, how does an authenticated user send requests to the server? The first option to consider would be to set an authentication token received from the server in localStorage. For sensitive information, this is not ideal because an evil wrongdoer can write a Javascript function in the browser that can steal your token (XSS). With it, they can add lame games to your collection — the horror. It's also tedious to append the token everywhere in your request headers. This would require setting the token inside the AuthContext and extracting it for every component that needs to send a request. It's not the ideal choice if you have loaders as well. 

 ```tsx
 // You'd need the token everywhere to make requests.
 Authorization: 'Bearer ' + token
 ```

&nbsp;



&nbsp;



### Cookies and CSRF Token.

A smarter approach would be to use cookies with a CSRF token. Cookies alone are vulnerable to CSRF, but if you add a CRSF token inside the client's requests, the server has more evidence to trust the source of your client. We shouldn't blindly trust the browser's cookies! From what I understand, the basic idea in Flask-JWT-Extended is: 

1. User logs in.
2. The server generates the access token (JWT). Within that JWT, there's another CSRF token encoded for an extra layer of security.
3. Flask sends back 2 cookies: an Http-Only cookie containing that JWT token, and another one the client can manipulate with Javascript.
4. The second one allows the client to extract the CSRF token and plug it in the headers for a request. Flask also sends an extra cookie with the value of the CSRF token.
5. Whenever a request is made, Flask verifies the JWT (@jwt_required), and that the CSRF token sent by the client matches the encoded one inside the JWT.


![Cookies wtih CSRF](../../assets/project_images/gameok/csrf.png)
&nbsp;

The requests are tailored like this: 
```tsx
export const fetchWithCSRF = async (url: string, options: RequestInit = {}) => {
  const csrfToken = getCookie("csrf_access_token");
  const headers = {
    ...(options.headers || {}),
    "X-CSRF-TOKEN": csrfToken || "",
  };

  return fetch(url, {
    ...options,
    headers,
    // Pass cookies back to your server
    // No need to manually pass the token with every request
    credentials: "include",
  });
};
```

where getCookie is:

```tsx
export const getCookie = (name: string): string | undefined => {

  // You add the semicolon at the beginning, so that the first cookie  gets extracted when you split the string.
  const value = `; ${document.cookie}`;

  // ; Cookie 1=Value; Cookie 2=Value; CSRFCookie=Value

  // Isolate the csrfToken
  const parts = value.split(`; ${name}=`);

  if (parts.length === 2) return parts.pop()
};
```



&nbsp;

### Session Expired
 The last thing I want to mention concerning authentication is handling token expiry with loaders. If a user stays inactive for the duration of the token's lifespan  and tries to make a request with the expired token, we can make use of loaders and error boundaries to log the user out. 

  &nbsp;

 Let's say I want to fetch all my game titles with an expired token. Bummer, the server sends back a 401 error (Unauthorized). Inside the loader, you can throw back the Response to an ErrorBoundary component. Note that you don't need the CSRF token for GET requests.

 ```tsx
//gamesLoader.ts
type GameTitle = string;
export  async function gamesLoader() {
  
      const response = await fetch("/api/game/get_all_game_titles", {
        method: "GET",
         credentials: "include",
      });
       if (response.status === 401) {
        // TO BE CAUGHT ErrorBoundary
        throw new Response("Unauthorized to fetch all game titles", { status: response.status });
      }

      else if (!response.ok) {
        
        throw new Response("Failed to fetch all game titles", { status: response.status });
      }
      const games = await response.json();
      return games as GameTitle[];
  
  }

 ```
 &nbsp;


The 401 error is handled with <b class= "bold-rounded">useRouteError</b> and <b class= "bold-rounded">isRouteErrorResponse</b>. The first one simply catches the error, and the second one identifies it from the response status. We can then redirect the user to the login page. This is done by setting the storedInfo's state to null. In Gameok,  a user is logged if their username is set in the global state.
```tsx
// ErrorBoundary.tsx
import { useRouteError, isRouteErrorResponse, Navigate } from "react-router-dom";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useAuthContext } from "@/context/AuthContext";

export default function ErrorBoundary() {
  const error = useRouteError();
  const [shouldRedirect, setShouldRedirect] = useState(false);
  const {setUserInfo} = useAuthContext()
  useEffect(() => {

    if (isRouteErrorResponse(error) && (error.status === 401 || error.status === 422)) {
    
      setUserInfo("")
      setShouldRedirect(true);
     
    }
    // Run the effect when an error occurs.
  }, [error]);

  if (shouldRedirect) {
    // replace/ ->  No more back button.
    return <Navigate to="/" replace />;
  }

  return <h1 className= "p-3">Unexpected error occurred  :(. <br/>Your session could have  expired. </h1>;
}

```

## Database

### Schema
The backend uses Flask with Blueprints and SQLAlchemy similar to what I did in my <a class="secondary-a" href="/projects/diary/#backend-structure"> Diary project</a>.  Here's a picture of the Gameok schema.<sup> <a class="secondary-a" href="#footnotes">4.</a></sup>


![Gameok Schema](../../assets/project_images/gameok/schema.png)

&nbsp;

As you can see, there are 3 main models and 2 association models:
- User: id, username, email and password 
- Game: id , title, year, series, cover_photo  
- Console: id as primary key, name, firm, year
- GameOwnership: Foreign key of User.id and Game.id as primary keys
- GameConsole: Foreign key of Game.id and Console.id as primary keys


&nbsp; 


A game can be owned by many users and vice versa which means it's a many-to-many relationship with the Game table. With many-to-many, we need a relationship table that links users and games. That's the purpose of the GameOwnership table which has an extra column 'memories' for a user to store the unique memories associated with the game. A similar many-to-many relationship exists between games and consoles: a Console can have many games and a game can be on many consoles. We represent this relationship with the GameConsole table. In SQLAlchemy, you use relationship.back_populates() to represent those associations. &nbsp;

&nbsp;

One design weakness is not adding the relationship between a User and a Console. A trivial consequence of that would be having to do 4 joins to get the consoles owned by the user which was something I needed to do in my app.


&nbsp;

### Useful Queries

My queries in the actual project use the legacy version(1.x) of SQLAlchemy, but here's the (2.x) way to do it. 

&nbsp;


1. Getting all games with their consoles.

```python
# Join Game to GameConsole on the game id, and then join Console.
stmt = select(Game, Console) \
    .join(GameConsole, GameConsole.game_id == Game.id) \
    .join(Console, Console.id == GameConsole.console_id)
```

&nbsp;

2. Getting all the consoles owned by the user.
```python
# Join Party 
stmt = select(Console).join(GameConsole, Console.id == GameConsole.console_id) \
    .join(Game, Game.id == GameConsole.game_id) \
    .join(GameOwnership, GameOwnership.game_id == Game.id) \
    .filter(GameOwnership.user_id == user_id)
```
&nbsp;

3. Getting the number of games of each owned console.


```python
stmt = (
    select(Console.name, func.count(Console.name))
    .join(GameConsole, GameConsole.console_id == Console.id)
    .join(Game, Game.id == GameConsole.game_id)
    .join(GameOwnership, GameOwnership.game_id == Game.id)
    .filter(GameOwnership.user_id == user_id)
    .group_by(Console.name)
)
```


&nbsp;



## Extras

### Animations with Motion

I've tinkered with <a class="secondary-a" href="https://motion.dev/"> motion.dev </a> to do most of the basic animations. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to implement exit animations for page transitions, but I eventually dropped the idea. It turns out that AnimatePresence wrapped around an Outlet in the data router doesn't work too well with loaders. Besides that setback, the library is useful for all sorts of operations such as adding error messages that disappear after a certain time. I did a lot of mistakes with it, and it taught me a lot on where to place the components to have them removed from the DOM. A reminder for myself is: "Don't forget to add keys to your motion components and really see what component is being removed and where."
&nbsp;



```tsx
// UserAddGame.tsx
// User tries to add a game that already exists 
// ...
 <ErrorBox key={count} handleDismiss={() => setResponse('')} response = {response} count= {count}/>

// ErrorBox.tsx 
import { AnimatePresence, easeInOut, motion } from "motion/react";
import {useState, useEffect} from "react"

type ErrorBoxProps = {
  handleDismiss: () => void;
  response: string;
  // Count is really useful for making the component exit.
  count?: number; 
};
const errorTransitionVariants = {
  initial: { opacity: 0 },
  animate: { opacity: 1 },
  exit: { opacity: 0 },
  transition : {duration: 0.2 , easeInOut}
};

export default function ErrorBox({ handleDismiss, response, count = 0 }: ErrorBoxProps) {

  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(true)

  // Remove the error message after 2 seconds
  // Set the visible again to true for the next animation.
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setVisible(false)
      handleDismiss();
      
    }, 2000)

    setVisible(true)
    return () => clearTimeout(timer)
  },[])
  
  return (

    <AnimatePresence mode="wait"> 
    
    {visible &&

    <motion.div
      key= {count}
      variants={errorTransitionVariants}
      initial="initial"
      animate="animate"
      exit="exit"
      className={"error-message"}
      transition={{ duration: 0.3, ease: "easeOut" }}
    >
      <p>{response}</p>
    </motion.div>
    }
    </AnimatePresence>
  )
```



&nbsp;



### Uploading Images

A Game object has a cover_photo field that holds the location of its image. When the admin adds a game to the database, we upload the cover photo from the request files like this: 

1. Check if the image exists.
2. Check the file extension.
3. Clean the filename for security.
4. Add a unique id to it.
5. Define the filepath with <b class="bold-rounded"> os.path</b>.
6. Save the file in our desired path.


```python
# config.py 
# In my case, basedir points to: backend/covers
UPLOAD_FOLDER = os.path.join(basedir, 'covers')
basedir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
```

&nbsp;


```python
# admin_routes.py
cover_photo = request.files['coverPhoto']
# Check if the cover photo exists and if it's either in a jpg or jpeg format.
if cover_photo and allowed_file(cover_photo.filename):
    # Clean and generate a unique filename.
    filename = secure_filename(cover_photo.filename)
    filename = f"{str(uuid.uuid4())}-{filename}"
    # Save to backend/covers.
    filepath = os.path.abspath(
        os.path.join(current_app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"], filename)
    )
    cover_photo.save(filepath)
```

&nbsp;


```python
# game_routes.py
@bp.route('/api/game/fetch_cover/<a_game_title>/', methods= ["GET"])
def fetch_cover(a_game_title):
     filename = Game.query.filter_by(title=a_game_title).first().cover_photo
     return send_from_directory(current_app.config["UPLOAD_FOLDER"], filename)
```

&nbsp;

You can now load the image in the client with:

```tsx
// UserAddGame.tsx
const gameTitle = "Banjo Kazooie"
const imageSource = `/api/game/fetch_cover/${game_title}/`
<img src={imageSource} alt="Banjo Kazooie"> 

```
     


&nbsp;

## Takeaways


If I were to take Gameok to the next level, I would learn how to implement the following:

-  Sending a confirmation e-mail to the registering user.
-  A cloud server the users can upload pictures to.
-  Managing the UI and UX when there's a lot of games and consoles.
-  Polishing the general look, and learning more about animations.
-  Adding more fields to the models.
-  And honestly a lot more. :)



&nbsp;

## Footnotes

1. It's a blend of the English word "game" and the Korean word "추억" (Choo-awk) which means precious memories.

2. All the covers are taken from various wiki sources. I don't own the rights to any of the images shown.

3. Framework mode felt a bit intimidating. 

4. I tried to keep the number of fields as simple as possible.
